| **Stochastic Computing for Machine Learning towards an Intelligent Edge** |
| Deep learning offers the promise of intelligent devices that are able to perceive, reason and take intuitive actions. The rising adoption of deep learning techniques has motivated the search for low-cost and high-speed software and hardware solutions for deployment on smart edge devices. In recent years work has focused on reducing the complexity of inference in deep neural networks, however, a method enabling low-complexity on-chip learning is still missing. In this talk we explore the promise of a hardware implementation technique called stochastic computing, which represents values in an algorithm as streams of randomly chosen bits. We show how stochastic computing can be used as a binary or ternary compression technique for both inference and training of deep neural networks. We also show how stochastic computing can implement invertible logic circuits that perform learning without backpropagation. |
